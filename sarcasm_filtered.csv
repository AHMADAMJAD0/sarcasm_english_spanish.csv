That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit.

I'm just surprised that so many consider it so important how one performs in these quick witted, personality contests. Just because a person is slightly off the mark in wits doesn't mean he/she would not be a good leader - able to make sound political decisions.
